      <p>Thanks for visiting my site!!  I am in the process of developing a new skill set in coding and quicly becoming proficient in all the tools neccessary to be a full time develoer.  As part of the coding bookcamp that I am enrolled in I have learned:  HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, API requests/data manipulations.  The intense course has provided me with a strong foundation for a new career in website developer</p>

      <p>My preious career was in organic synthetic chemistry and its application for drug discovery programs. The organizational skill sets I have aquired in the pharmaceutical industry have applications in the web developing sphere.</p>

      <p>I am a results driven professional that embraces new opportunities with the goal of solving complex problems.  I have gained valuable experience in my career and in the coding bootcamp to work in group or individual settings.  Thanks for your consideration and please review my protfolio for a description of the work I have developed in my growing new career!!</p>
